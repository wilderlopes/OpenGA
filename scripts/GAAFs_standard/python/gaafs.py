# Script to call the GAAFs binaries.

#
# The following Python 2.7 script calls the GA-LMS (standard) binary to perform a system identification task. 
# 
# In this example, the multivectors samples belong to the Geometric Algebra of $\mathbb{R}^3$. 
# Thus, each regressor and weight vector entry has 8 coefficients, i.e., for each entry of 
# the weight vector, 8 coefficients have to be estimated. This constrasts with the usal LMS 
# which only estimates real/complex entries. For further information, please refer to the 
# GA documentation at www.openga.org. 
# 
# At the end, the learning curves Mean-Square Error (MSE) and/or Excess Mean-Square Error (EMSE) are plotted.

# Simulation parameters
#====================================================
# The user is able to set the following AF parameters:
# 
# Number of filter taps (system order): M
# 
# Realizations: L
# 
# Time iterations: N
# 
# AF step size: mu
# 
# Measurement Noise variance: sigma2v

M       = 5 # System order
L       = 100 # Realizations
N       = 1000 # Time iterations
mu      = 0.005 # AF Step size
sigma2v = 1e-3 # Variance of measurement noise
BINARY  = 'GA-LMS' # Note that you can call any of the following binaries:
		   # GA-LMS --> Complete subalgebra of R^3
		   # GA-LMS_rotors --> Even subalgebra of R^3 (isomorphic to quaternions)
		   # GA-LMS_complex --> Even subalgebra of R^2 (isomorphic to complex numbers)
		   # GA-LMS_real --> Even subalgebra of R (isomorphic to the real numbers)

# The binary is called below using the previously set parameters. The GA-LMS runs and 
# returns .txt files with the results: *_galms.out and *_theory.out, where * represents 
# "MSE" or "EMSE". *_galms.out files store the ensemble-average learning curves (EMSE), 
# while *_theory.out files store the theoretical steady-state value for MSE and EMSE.
